# data-encryption-using-python
This project demonstrates text encryption and decryption using Python. It applies basic cryptographic techniques to secure data and helps beginners understand how encryption works programmatically.

# Python Encryption Projects

This repository contains a collection of **Python-based encryption, hashing, and message authentication projects**. It is designed for learning, experimentation, and demonstration of cryptography concepts using Python.

## Features

1. **Text Encryption & Decryption CLI (`encryption_tool.py`)**
   - Symmetric encryption using Fernet
   - Asymmetric encryption using RSA
   - Hashing using SHA-256

2. **AES File Encryption (`aes_file_encryptor.py`)**
   - Encrypt and decrypt files using AES (EAX mode)
   - Generates a random AES key for each encryption
   - Saves encrypted files and allows decryption with the correct key

3. **File Hashing & Integrity Check (`file_hash_checker.py`)**
   - Generate SHA-256 hash for any file
   - Verify file integrity using stored hash values

4. **AES & RSA Message Encryption CLI (`aes_rsa_encryptor.py`)**
   - Demonstrates both AES symmetric and RSA asymmetric encryption
   - Allows encryption and decryption of user messages

5. **Digital Signatures & HMAC (`digital_signature_hmac.py`)**
   - Create and verify RSA-based digital signatures
   - Generate and verify HMAC (SHA-256) for message authentication
